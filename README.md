Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection and Power Curve Analysis
Overview
This project processes wind turbine data to detect anomalies, generate power curves, and produce comprehensive reports for each site. The data consists of wind speed and turbine production values, which are used to create machine learning models (PKL files) for anomaly detection. For each turbine at each site, power curve charts are generated and combined into PDF reports.

The project involves:

Processing turbine data for wind speed and production values.
Applying machine learning models to detect anomalies.
Creating power curve charts for each turbine.
Generating a PDF report for each site with all power curves.
Combining anomaly points with normal data for further analysis.
